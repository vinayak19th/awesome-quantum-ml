## Variational circuits

Variational circuits are quantum circuits with variable parameters that can be optimized to compute a given function. They can for instance be used to classify or predict properties of quantum and classical data, sample over complicated probability distributions (as generative models), or solve optimization and simulation problems.

## QRAM-based quantum ML

The following QML algorithms assume the existence of an efficient way to load classical data on a quantum device, such as a quantum RAM (QRAM). While this can be a complicated requirement in the short-term, QRAM-based algorithms often come with a rigourously-proven speed-up.
